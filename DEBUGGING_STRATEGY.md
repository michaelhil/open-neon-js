## 🎯 GitHub Issues Integration Strategy

### Issue Templates with Research Context

**Hardware-Specific Templates:**
- **Neon Device Issues** - Capture device model, firmware version, serial number, calibration status
- **Invisible Device Issues** - Different template for Invisible-specific features and limitations  
- **Network Environment Issues** - WiFi vs Ethernet, institutional firewalls, mDNS discovery problems
- **Multi-Device Setup Issues** - Synchronization, interference, bandwidth allocation

**Research Workflow Templates:**
- **PsychoPy Integration Issues** - Experiment script compatibility, timing synchronization, data export
- **jsPsych Integration Issues** - Browser compatibility, WebSocket limitations, performance optimization
- **Custom Research Software** - API integration, data format compatibility, real-time processing
- **Data Analysis Pipeline Issues** - Export formats, statistical software compatibility, reproducibility

**Auto-Context Collection Enhancement:**
```javascript
// Extend existing getEnvironmentInfo() function
{
  hardware: {
    deviceModel: 'Neon',
    firmwareVersion: '2.1.4',
    batteryLevel: 78,
    calibrationAge: '2 hours',
    lastSyncTime: '2024-08-22T14:30:00Z'
  },
  research: {
    institutionType: 'university', // anonymized
    studyType: 'behavioral', // anonymized
    participantSession: 'session_42', // anonymized
    experimentDuration: '45 minutes'
  },
  network: {
    connectionType: 'wifi',
    latencyP95: '15ms',
    packetLoss: '0.02%',
    firewallDetected: true,
    institutionalProxy: true
  }
}
```

### Smart Issue Classification System

**Automatic Labeling Strategy:**
- `hardware:neon` / `hardware:invisible` - Based on device detection
- `network:discovery` / `network:streaming` / `network:sync` - Based on error codes
- `integration:psychopy` / `integration:jspsych` / `integration:custom` - Based on stack traces
- `severity:data-loss` / `severity:performance` / `severity:usability` - Based on research impact
- `research-stage:pilot` / `research-stage:data-collection` / `research-stage:analysis` - Based on urgency

**Priority Assignment Logic:**
- **P0 Critical:** Data corruption, device safety issues, IRB compliance violations
- **P1 High:** Research deadline blockers, grant-funded study impact, publication deadlines
- **P2 Medium:** Performance degradation, usability issues, feature requests
- **P3 Low:** Documentation updates, code cleanup, nice-to-have features
