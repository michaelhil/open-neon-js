## LLM Integration Scenario

### Overview
A particularly compelling future use case involves integrating the Open Neon JS library with Large Language Models (LLMs) through an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. This would enable intelligent systems to understand and respond to user attention patterns in real-time.

### Current API Assessment

**Strengths of Existing API:**
- Provides comprehensive low-level streaming capabilities with 200Hz gaze data
- Offers complete device control including recording, calibration, and status monitoring  
- Cross-platform compatibility ensures broad deployment options
- Real-time WebSocket streaming suitable for responsive LLM integration
- Robust error handling and connection management

**Limitations for LLM Integration:**
- Primarily focused on raw data streams rather than semantic interpretation
- Lacks high-level abstraction for common gaze patterns and behaviors
- No built-in context correlation with screen content or interface elements
- Missing batch processing capabilities for historical analysis
- Limited semantic metadata in data structures

### Recommended API Enhancements

#### High-Level Semantic APIs
To better support LLM integration, the API should provide semantic interpretation of raw gaze data:

- **`getGazeSummary(timeWindow)`**: Aggregate gaze metrics over specified time periods, including average fixation duration, saccade velocity, and attention distribution
- **`getAttentionAreas()`**: Identify regions of high visual attention with statistical significance
- **`isLookingAt(target)`**: Boolean determination of whether the user is currently focused on a specific screen element or coordinate region

#### Contextual Gaze Interpretation
LLMs benefit from understanding the meaning behind gaze patterns:

- **`getGazePattern()`**: Classify current gaze behavior as reading, scanning, fixation, or search patterns
- **`identifyAttentionShift()`**: Detect and characterize significant changes in attention focus
- **`getEngagementLevel()`**: Calculate user engagement metrics based on gaze stability and pattern consistency

#### LLM-Friendly Data Formats
Current JSON responses should be enhanced with semantic meaning:

- **Structured semantic responses**: Include human-readable descriptions alongside numeric data
- **Confidence indicators**: Provide reliability scores for gaze interpretations
- **Contextual metadata**: Include relevant environmental and calibration context
- **Natural language descriptions**: Generate text summaries of gaze behavior suitable for LLM processing

#### State Query Helpers
LLMs need to understand device and session context:

- **`getDeviceHealthStatus()`**: Comprehensive system status including calibration quality, tracking confidence, and hardware performance
- **`isCalibrated()`**: Detailed calibration status with quality metrics and recommendations
- **`getConnectionQuality()`**: Network performance metrics affecting data reliability
- **`getSessionContext()`**: Information about current tracking session, participant, and experimental conditions

#### Event-Driven Patterns
Enable LLMs to react to specific gaze events:

- **`waitForGazeEvent(condition)`**: Asynchronous waiting for specific gaze conditions (e.g., fixation on target area)
- **`onAttentionShift(callback)`**: Event handlers for significant attention changes
- **`onCalibrationChange(callback)`**: Notifications when calibration quality changes
- **`onEngagementThreshold(callback)`**: Alerts when user engagement crosses defined thresholds

#### Batch Data Operations
Support for historical analysis and pattern recognition:

- **`getGazeHistory(timeRange)`**: Retrieve and process historical gaze data with filtering options
- **`getFixationSummary()`**: Aggregate fixation statistics over specified periods
- **`generateGazeReport()`**: Comprehensive analysis reports suitable for LLM interpretation
- **`exportSemanticData(format)`**: Export gaze data with semantic annotations in various formats

#### Screen-Context Integration
Connect gaze data with interface elements and content:

- **`correlateGazeWithScreenContent()`**: Map gaze coordinates to specific UI elements, text regions, or content areas
- **`getVisualElementsUnderGaze()`**: Identify which interface components are currently being viewed
- **`trackContentEngagement()`**: Measure how users interact visually with specific content types
- **`getReadingMetrics()`**: Specialized metrics for text-based content consumption

### Integration Benefits

**Contextual Understanding:**
LLMs integrated with eye tracking can understand what users are actually paying attention to, enabling more relevant and timely responses. This creates opportunities for truly context-aware AI assistance.

**Multimodal Interaction:**
Combining gaze data with voice and text input creates rich interaction possibilities. Users can look at something and ask "what's this?" or "help me with this section," enabling more natural human-AI collaboration.

**Adaptive Interface Design:**
LLM systems can dynamically adjust interface layouts, content presentation, and information density based on real-time attention patterns, improving user experience and task efficiency.

**Accessibility Applications:**
Eye tracking combined with LLMs opens new possibilities for users with motor impairments, enabling gaze-based control of AI systems and hands-free interaction with complex digital environments.

**Learning and Training:**
Educational applications can use gaze-aware LLMs to provide personalized instruction, identify comprehension difficulties, and adapt teaching strategies based on attention patterns.

### Technical Considerations

**Real-Time Performance:**
The MCP server will need to handle high-frequency data streams while maintaining low latency for responsive LLM integration. This requires careful optimization of data processing and transmission pipelines.

**Error Handling:**
Error messages and system states must be comprehensible to LLMs, requiring clear semantic descriptions rather than technical error codes. This includes graceful degradation when eye tracking quality decreases.

**Data Quality Indicators:**
LLMs need to understand the reliability of gaze data to make appropriate decisions. All API responses should include confidence levels, tracking quality metrics, and data validity indicators.

**Privacy and Consent:**
Gaze data is highly personal and reveals cognitive patterns. Integration with LLMs requires robust privacy protection, explicit consent mechanisms, and clear data usage policies.

**Calibration Management:**
LLMs should understand calibration status and quality, potentially guiding users through recalibration processes when tracking accuracy degrades.

### Implementation Priority

**Assessment**: Medium priority - valuable enhancement for future AI integration use cases.

**Rationale**: While the current API can support basic LLM integration through an MCP server, these enhancements would significantly improve the quality and usefulness of such integrations. The semantic layer would make gaze data much more accessible to LLMs, enabling more sophisticated and context-aware applications.

**Development Approach**: These enhancements should be implemented as a higher-level semantic layer built on top of the existing low-level streaming API, maintaining backward compatibility while adding new capabilities for AI integration.

## MQTT Streaming Integration Scenario

    this.client = mqtt.connect(options.broker, options.clientOptions)
    this.topic = options.topic
    this.qos = options.qos || 1
    this.retain = options.retain || false
  }
  
  createStream(gazeStream) {
    return new Observable(observer => {
      const subscription = gazeStream.subscribe({
        next: data => {
          this.client.publish(this.topic, JSON.stringify(data), {
            qos: this.qos,
            retain: this.retain
          }, (error) => {
            if (error) observer.error(error)
            else observer.next(data)
          })
        },
        error: err => observer.error(err),
        complete: () => observer.complete()
      })
      
      return () => {
        subscription.unsubscribe()
        this.client.end()
      }
    })
  }
}
```
